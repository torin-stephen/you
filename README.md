YOU Viewer - README.txt
=================================

Program Overview:
-----------------
YOU Viewer is a tool designed for encoding and decoding files into a custom obfuscated format with the `.you` extension. The tool allows users to obfuscate various file types (e.g., `.zip`, `.rar`, `.png`, `.txt`, etc.) and store them in a secure, non-readable format, protecting sensitive or private data. This is particularly useful for ensuring that files are not easily accessed or viewed without the appropriate software.

Key Features:
-------------
- **Encode Files**: Convert files into the `.you` format. The files are obfuscated using an XOR-based encryption technique.
- **Decode Files**: Reverse the obfuscation process to restore the original file.
- **File Association**: Automatically associates the `.you` file extension with the program for easy access.
- **Cross-format Support**: Supports encoding and decoding of multiple file types, including `.txt`, `.zip`, `.png`, `.rar`, and more.
- **Simple Interface**: The program offers an easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI) for file selection and conversion between formats.

Use Cases:
-----------
- **Data Protection**: Encode sensitive files before sharing them online to prevent unauthorized access.
- **File Storage**: Secure your files in an obfuscated format to keep them private and protect them from prying eyes.
- **Backup Strategy**: Obfuscate files to create backups that can't be easily accessed by third parties.
